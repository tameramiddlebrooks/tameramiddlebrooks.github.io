**My Approach to Creating The Game**
When creating the game, I started with the basics of declaring my variables for my scoreboard and displaying the results. Next, it's important to create the variables needed for each button in the game, (as well as your reset button) since those are a core aspect of the game being playable. To create these variables, using the getElementById() method would be your best bet. The next few steps were creating multiple functions for all of the conditions of the game (winning condition, losing condition, tie condition), as well as the function to randomly generate the computer's choice. I also created the "main" function of the game using switch statements to determine every possible outcome between the user and the computer. Finally, I created my functions to reset the scoreboard back to 0, as well as all a function to make sure each of my buttons were working and clickable.

**Problems Experienced**
While creating the game, the bulk of my difficulties were with my buttons and making sure they were fully functional. If there's a desire to re-create it yourself, be mindful that you follow the proper syntax for creating your buttons and firing your click events, as well as properly writing the code within the event handler function that will run when you call the function.
